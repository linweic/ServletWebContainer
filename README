Which features did you implement? 
  (list features, or write 'Entire assignment')
	1, constructed a HTTP server compliant to both 1.0 and 1.1 version
	2, return a list of subfiles when a directory is requested
	3, return correct MIME types for some basic file formats. based on given extensions.
	4, only support GET and HEAD method, other request methods will be return with error response 
	5, handle multiple HTTP error responses to client
	6, implemented special urls like /shutdown to shutdown the server gracefully and /control to return a control page
		When you type in "http://localhost:8080/shutdown", probably there is no reaction for the first time you tap "enter", second time it works, which is strange and I cannot tell the reason.
	7, respond interim message 100 continue when "Expect" header is detected
